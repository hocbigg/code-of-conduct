* Criticize ideas, not people.
* Discuss publicly. Refrain from direct messaging people unless it is specifically requested.

# Prohibitions

* No sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any other prejudiced or discriminatory language or actions; this includes jokes.

* No revealing another's private information against their wishes (doxxing).
* No stalking or intimidation, online or otherwise.
